exports[`cli stdout should print build usage by alias: print build usage by alias 1`] = `
"
Description
  Compiles the codebase with options inference.

Usage
  esw build [entry] [options]

  [entry] represents the library entry point.
          esw would run options inference when an entry point isn't explicitly specified.
          On the other hand, you should always specify an entry point explicitly when the main and module have a different basename.

          Note that a part of inferred options didn't work once we found multiple entry points.
